# Week 10: Reinforcement Learning with Isaac Lab

Train robot policies using reinforcement learning in Isaac Lab.

## Isaac Lab

Isaac Lab (formerly Isaac Gym) provides:
- **Massively parallel** simulation
- **RL training** integration
- **Sim-to-real** transfer

```python
from omni.isaac.lab.app import AppLauncher
app_launcher = AppLauncher()

from omni.isaac.lab_tasks.manager_based.locomotion import LocomotionEnv

env = LocomotionEnv(cfg=cfg)
```

## Training Workflow

1. Define the task
2. Configure the environment
3. Train the policy
4. Evaluate and deploy

## Exercise

Train a simple locomotion policy using Isaac Lab.
