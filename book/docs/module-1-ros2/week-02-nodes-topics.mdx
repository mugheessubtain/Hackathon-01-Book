# Week 2: Nodes and Topics

Learn how ROS 2 nodes communicate using the publish-subscribe pattern with topics.

## Topics

Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. They implement a publish-subscribe pattern:
- **Publishers** send messages to topics
- **Subscribers** receive messages from topics

```python
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String

class Publisher(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('publisher')
        self.publisher = self.create_publisher(String, 'my_topic', 10)
        self.timer = self.create_timer(1.0, self.timer_callback)
        
    def timer_callback(self):
        msg = String()
        msg.data = 'Hello ROS 2!'
        self.publisher.publish(msg)
```

## Message Types

ROS 2 uses strongly-typed messages. Common types include:
- `std_msgs/String`
- `geometry_msgs/Pose`
- `sensor_msgs/Image`

## Exercise

Create a publisher and subscriber that exchange custom messages.
