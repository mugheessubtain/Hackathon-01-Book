# Week 4: Actions

Learn about ROS 2 actions for long-running tasks with feedback.

## What are Actions?

Actions are for tasks that:
- Take time to complete
- Provide periodic feedback
- Can be cancelled

```python
from action_tutorials_interfaces.action import Fibonacci

class ActionServer(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('action_server')
        self._action_server = ActionServer(
            self,
            Fibonacci,
            'fibonacci',
            self.execute_callback
        )
    
    def execute_callback(self, goal_handle):
        # Send periodic feedback
        # Return final result
        pass
```

## Action Components

1. **Goal**: What you want to accomplish
2. **Feedback**: Progress updates
3. **Result**: Final outcome

## Exercise

Create an action server for a navigation task.
