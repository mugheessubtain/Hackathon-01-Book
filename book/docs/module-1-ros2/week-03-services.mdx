# Week 3: Services

Discover ROS 2 services for request-response communication patterns.

## What are Services?

Services provide a synchronous request-response mechanism. Unlike topics:
- **One-to-one communication** (not one-to-many)
- **Blocking calls** (wait for response)
- **Request-response pattern**

```python
from example_interfaces.srv import AddTwoInts

class ServiceNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('service_node')
        self.srv = self.create_service(
            AddTwoInts,
            'add_two_ints',
            self.add_callback
        )
    
    def add_callback(self, request, response):
        response.sum = request.a + request.b
        return response
```

## When to Use Services

Use services when:
- You need a response immediately
- The operation is fast and doesn't block
- You want synchronous communication

## Exercise

Create a service that processes robot commands and returns status.
