# Week 1: Introduction to ROS 2

Welcome to ROS 2! In this chapter, you'll learn the fundamentals of the Robot Operating System 2.

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is an open-source middleware framework for robotics. It provides:
- **Communication infrastructure** for distributed systems
- **Tools and libraries** for building robot applications
- **Hardware abstraction** for different sensors and actuators

## Key Concepts

### Nodes
Nodes are the basic computational units in ROS 2. Each node represents a process that performs specific tasks.

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MyNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('my_node')
        self.get_logger().info('Node started!')

def main():
    rclpy.init()
    node = MyNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    rclpy.shutdown()
```

## Installation

Follow the [official ROS 2 installation guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html) for your platform.

## Exercise

Try creating your first ROS 2 node using the code example above.

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll explore nodes and topics in depth.
