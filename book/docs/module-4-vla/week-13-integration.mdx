# Week 13: Integrating VLA Models with Robots

Put it all together: integrate VLA models into a complete robotic system.

## System Architecture

A VLA-powered robot system includes:
- **Perception**: Vision input processing
- **Language**: Command understanding
- **Action**: Motor control output

## Integration Steps

1. Set up the robot hardware/simulation
2. Load and configure the VLA model
3. Create the control loop
4. Test and iterate

```python
def control_loop(robot, vla_model):
    while True:
        # Capture image
        image = robot.get_camera_image()
        
        # Get command
        command = get_user_command()
        
        # Predict action
        action = vla_model.predict(image, command)
        
        # Execute
        robot.execute_action(action)
```

## Exercise

Build a complete system that responds to natural language commands.

## Project Ideas

- Pick and place with voice commands
- Navigation with visual goals
- Manipulation with language descriptions

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed the Physical AI textbook fundamentals. Continue practicing and building your own projects.
