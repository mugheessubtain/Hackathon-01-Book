# Week 11: Vision Models for Robotics

Learn how vision models enable robots to perceive and understand their environment.

## Vision in Robotics

Vision models help robots:
- **Detect and recognize** objects
- **Estimate poses** and positions
- **Segment scenes** for understanding

## Common Architectures

- **CNNs**: Convolutional Neural Networks
- **Vision Transformers**: ViT models
- **CLIP**: Contrastive vision-language models

```python
import torch
from transformers import CLIPModel, CLIPProcessor

model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
```

## Exercise

Implement object detection for a robot vision system.
