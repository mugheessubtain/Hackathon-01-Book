# Week 12: Language Models for Robot Commands

Discover how language models enable natural language interaction with robots.

## Language for Robotics

Language models allow robots to:
- **Understand** natural language commands
- **Plan** task sequences
- **Reason** about actions

## VLA Models

Vision-Language-Action models combine:
- **Vision**: See the environment
- **Language**: Understand commands
- **Action**: Execute motor commands

```python
# Example: Using a VLA model
from transformers import AutoModel

vla_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("openvla/openvla-7b")
```

## Exercise

Create a natural language interface for robot control.
